#### Phase Two  
**Demonstration Model Interface** (Pulse Position Modulation With Binary Inputs)  
Develop a demonstration model interface that connects to a RC transmitter via its organic Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) Trainer Port. Initially the control signal inputs will be the same as the Phase One control signal inputs. No modifications would be required for either the RC radio system or the sailboat systems.
