### Adaptive RC Sailing Group
The Adaptive RC Sailing Group is intended to be a community center for exchanging ideas related to creating and developing various techniques for those RC skippers who may have undergone debilitating injuries or disease. Hopefully, participants and contributors will include both those with questions and especially those with proposed solutions to situations related to adaptive RC model sailboating. Initially, the overall project was divided into three phases. Please refer to the Wiki [Requirements Document](https://github.com/adaptivercsailing/adaptivercsailing/wiki) for an overview of the entire scope and to the individual **Phase Folders** for access to the respective design notes and source files. Each Phase Folder also includes an **Experimental Folder** that contains programming details, links to datasheets, and references to other important actions and files.

#### Phase One
Incorporates an Arduino UNO micro-controller interface using digital potentiometers that can be easily connected to most radio transmitters used by RC skippers. Readily available adaptive devices (for example, sip & puff switches), already familiar to physically disabled individuals, are used to bridge the gap between the skipper and his/her sailboat. [Phase One](/Phase_One)

#### Phase Two
Uses the transmitter's Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) Trainer Port as the means for connecting the Arduino adaptive interface to the transmitter. [Phase Two](/Phase_Two)
 
#### Phase Three
Expands the control signal input modalities to include a Voice Recognition Command module. [Phase Three](/Phase_Three)
